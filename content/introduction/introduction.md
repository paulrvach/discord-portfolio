# Welcome — Start Here

Hi, I'm **Paul**. This server is my portfolio in Discord form. Here's who I am and how to get around.

## Who I Am

- **CS student** at **Irvine Valley College** (IVC)
- **Software Engineer** — building and shipping code
- **Former Music Producer** — still an audiophile and maker at heart

I'm based in Orange County, CA, and open to opportunities. The channels below are the main sections of this server.
